# UnifyWeaver_Education

**Educational Materials for [UnifyWeaver](https://github.com/s243a/UnifyWeaver)**

This project contains comprehensive educational materials for learning UnifyWeaver - a Prolog-to-Code compiler that transforms declarative logic programs into efficient streaming scripts. The content is organized into two books covering different aspects of the system.

## Book Structure

### 📘 Book 1: Core UnifyWeaver & Bash Target
**[📖 Read Book 1](book-1-core-bash/README.md)** | **Location:** `book-1-core-bash/`

Covers fundamental concepts and Bash code generation:
- Prolog basics and UnifyWeaver architecture
- Stream compilation and template system
- Advanced recursion patterns
- Data source plugins (CSV, JSON, Python, HTTP, AWK, XML)
- Partitioning and parallel execution
- Complete ETL pipeline examples

**Start here if you're new to UnifyWeaver.**

### 📗 Book 2: C# Target Language
**[📖 Read Book 2](book-2-csharp-target/README.md)** | **Location:** `book-2-csharp-target/`

Covers multi-target compilation and C# / .NET:
- C# Stream Target (direct source generation)
- C# Query Runtime (IR + runtime library)
- LINQ-based query execution
- Cross-platform .NET deployment
- Performance optimization

**Complete Book 1 before starting Book 2.**

### 📓 Jupyter Notebooks
**[📖 View Notebooks](notebooks/README.md)** | **Location:** `notebooks/`

Interactive notebooks for hands-on experimentation with UnifyWeaver concepts.
