# Chapter 1: Thinking in Workflows

## From Scripts to Strategies

In traditional programming and system administration, we often think in terms of **scripts**. A script is a linear sequence of commands designed to achieve a specific, well-defined task. It operates like a recipe: follow the steps in order, and you will get the expected result.

UnifyWeaver, at its core, is a powerful tool for creating highly efficient scripts from declarative logic. However, the true power of a modern AI-driven development environment lies in moving beyond rigid recipes.

This book introduces a new way of thinking: **thinking in Workflows**.

A Workflow is not just a script; it is a **Strategy Guide** for an intelligent AI agent. Instead of a single, fixed plan, a Workflow provides the agent with:

*   A clear **goal**.
*   A **menu of different strategies** to achieve that goal.
*   A **library of tools** (like the `ancestor` example) required to execute those strategies.
*   The **economic data** (cost, speed, quality) associated with each strategy.
*   **Heuristic guidance** to help the agent choose the best strategy for a given situation.

In this model, the AI agent is not a simple script executor. It is an **economic strategist** that makes intelligent, resource-aware decisions. This book will teach you how to design and build these Workflows, empowering you to collaborate with AI agents on a whole new level.
